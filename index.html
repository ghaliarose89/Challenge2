                        Ghalia is an ambitious and friendly girl. She was born in Syria in 1989. Ghalia lived and grew up in Damascus until the age of 23. Her favorite hobby is to help needy people and see them happy. For that, she spends most of her free time in charities and organizations to support fresh refugees and immigrants. Ghalia always dreams to be a software developer to create and invent new technology programs which would help mankind. Her dream was paused when the war broke out in her country.
                        Although Ghaliaâ€™s dreams and goals stopped for a while because of the war, she did not give up. Ghalia and her family decided to flee to the United States for a better life.  She moved with her parents and her only brother to Houston, Texas, in 2016. When she moved to the new city, Ghalia and her family faced many obstacles, but they succeeded to overtake all of them. Two months later, Ghalia persisted to achieve her goal. She applied to Houston Community College and began the EOSL program to continue her education.
